# CodeAlpha_Project_Secure_Coding_Review

This is my third and last task of the internship.

Overview:
This repository contains a comprehensive review of a Flask application for potential security vulnerabilities. The review highlights common security pitfalls associated with Flask applications and provides best practice recommendations to mitigate these risks. 

# About Flask

Flask is a popular micro web framework for Python, but like any web application framework, it can be susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. This project aims to educate developers on secure practices when developing applications with Flask and to provide a codebase compliant with these principles.

Recommendations for Secure Coding Practices
- Always Escape Output
- Implement CSRF Protection
- Manage Secrets Securely
- Validate and Sanitize User Input
- Use Parameterized Queries
- Regularly Update Dependencies
